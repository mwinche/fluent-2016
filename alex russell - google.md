Progressive web apps
====================

## Alex Russell - Google @slightlylate

Distribution is the hardest problem in software

* 13% of mobile time on the mobile web vs 87% of time in apps
* More unique users across on the web though, (they're using the same apps)
* 80% of time spent is in user's top 3 apps

> Winner take all dynamic

Most native mobile apps aren't even being discovered (the "zombie problem")

> You don't want to read our content right now, WAIT 3 MINUTES AND INSTALL OUR APP

Behavior like that doesn't even help number of mobile installs (as per Google's internal data)

> With all these downsides to native applications, what is holding the web back

Not the tech. At least not how we think.

Alex's theory why:

1. Homescreen access
2. Push notifications
3. Offline

Manifest that can declare a webpage as an app (name, url, icon...)

Respectful prompts for push notifications

Offline that really works

> It isn't an app if it doesn't work when you tap

Google wants the offline dinosaur to go away

Service workers are Network Progressive Enhancement (application shell architecture)

Application shell architecture in Angular talk tomorrow. (Could be a talk for the meetup)
