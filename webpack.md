From require.js to webpack
==========================

## Jamund Ferguson @xjamundx

5to6-codemod (tools to help you migrate from ES5 to ES6 syntax)

Webpack option: `moduleDirectories: ['public/js', 'node_modules']`

> npm is the information super highway of JavaScript

webpack --display-modules (show me what what used to build my modules, why is it so big)
webpack --verbose (shows where each module got included)

Webpack Validator (by Kent)

Avoid writing webpack-specific code

no need to get rid of gulp/grunt

Jamund's car example is fantastic. You have a good car, you switch it for the fancy new thing,
but you find that the old car was really what you needed.
