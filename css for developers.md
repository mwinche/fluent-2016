border-box is da shiz.

Root element as border-box and everything else inherit.

Feb 1st International Box Sizing awareness day.

Specificity sucks.

Positioning, also sucks. Position sticky has an upcoming spec.

Psuedo elements, attr() "function" for content attribute of psuedo element. "currentColor"
on psudeo elements totally works apparently.

CSS Alignment is a pain. (css tricks has a nice flow chart thing for vertical align).

Flexbox Froggy and Flexbox Defense. What the flexbox.

Variables: use Sass or Less. But watch for too much nesting! Mixins are nice (although
  sometimes, I've noticed unncessary).

Autoprefixer FTW!

PostCSS is fast build time and is awesome.

CSSNext!

Do I use (tool for analyzing CSS for unsupported things).

Problem: ALL CSS IS GLOBAL.

css-loader in Webpack.

Lint your CSS. (Stylelint)

> It (CSS) can get out of hand quicker than your JavaScript can.
