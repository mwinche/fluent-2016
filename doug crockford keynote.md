======================

HTTP ("the web") was designed as a document retrieval system.

Introducing the seif project.

* Ditches HTML, CSS, HTTP, HTTPS
* All communication is encrypted JSON
* Public/private keys inherent in the system
* Ditches passwords (see above)

Seif is another way to do stuff without getting rid of what the web already does.

5 stages:
1. seif node
2. seif prototcol
3. seif resource management
4. seif apps
5. seif helper app

Initially, all projects have insecurity.

> Only a minimal approach can produce software that is eventually secure.
