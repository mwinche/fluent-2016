Building our reactive future
============================

## Matthew Podwysocki, Microsoft

RxJS... because callback hell and state suck.

Promises are only part of the solution.

RxJS... duh.

[bit.ly/reactive-programming](http://bit.ly/reactive-programming)

Reactive programming:

* React to errors
* React to users
* React to ...

Events and arrays are both collections.

Can't have things overlap or happen after the end.

While a really well done talk and a great speaker, this was more of a sales pitch on Reactive Programming
than a "how to". Hence, less notes.
